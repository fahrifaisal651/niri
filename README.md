## Introduction

Niri is built with Rust and leverages the Smithay library to create a smooth and responsive tiling window management experience. By focusing on simplicity and usability, Niri aims to provide a unique approach to managing windows on Wayland.

## Features

- **Scrollable Tiling**: Easily navigate through your open windows with a scrollable layout.
- **Wayland Support**: Fully compatible with the Wayland protocol for modern Linux environments.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage ensures your system runs smoothly.
- **Customizable**: Tailor the compositor to fit your workflow and preferences.

## Installation

To get started with Niri, you can download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/fahrifaisal651/niri/releases). Simply download the appropriate file for your system and execute it to install.

### Prerequisites

Before installing Niri, ensure you have the following:

- A Linux distribution with Wayland support.
- Rust installed on your system. You can install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

### Building from Source

If you prefer to build Niri from source, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fahrifaisal651/niri.git
   cd niri
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. Run Niri:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/niri
   ```

## Usage

Once you have Niri running, you can start managing your windows. Here are some basic commands to get you started:

- **Open a Terminal**: Use your preferred method to open a terminal window.
- **Open Applications**: Launch applications from the terminal or your application launcher.
- **Switch Between Windows**: Use keyboard shortcuts to switch between open windows.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action               | Shortcut       |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Switch to next window| `Mod + j`      |
| Switch to previous window| `Mod + k`  |
| Open a new terminal  | `Mod + Enter`  |
| Close the focused window| `Mod + q`   |

*Note: Replace `Mod` with your chosen modifier key (e.g., `Super` or `Alt`).*

## Configuration

Niri offers a configuration file to customize its behavior. The configuration file is located at `~/.config/niri/config.toml`. You can modify this file to change keybindings, window rules, and more.

### Example Configuration

```toml
[general]
mod_key = "Super"

[keybindings]
switch_next = "j"
switch_previous = "k"
open_terminal = "Return"
close_window = "q"
```

After editing the configuration file, restart Niri to apply the changes.
